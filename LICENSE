--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    2. RESTRICTIONS - FOR COMPETITORS ONLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following restrictions apply ONLY to those who wish to use this Software
to build competing products or services. If you are using the Software for
your own website, business, or personal projects, these restrictions DO NOT
apply to you.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you may NOT:

  a) COMPETING SAAS PROHIBITION: Use the Software, or any derivative work
     thereof, to provide a product or service that competes with the Software.
     A "Competing Use" includes, but is not limited to:

     - Offering the Software, or a substantially similar product derived from
       the Software, as a hosted or managed service to third parties
     - Providing testimonial collection, management, display, or related
       services as a primary offering that is substantially based on the
       Software
     - Selling, licensing, or otherwise commercially distributing the Software
       or any derivative work as a standalone product or as a core component
       of a product that replicates the primary functionality of the Software
     - Operating a "white-label" or "reseller" service based on the Software

  b) PARTIAL USE AND FEATURE EXTRACTION PROHIBITION: Extract, copy, adapt,
     port, or incorporate ANY portion of the Software into a competing product
     or service. This includes, but is not limited to:

     - Individual features, modules, or functionality
     - UI/UX components, designs, layouts, or visual elements
     - Algorithms, data structures, or business logic
     - API designs, schemas, or interface patterns
     - Code snippets, functions, classes, or libraries
     - Configuration files, templates, or assets
     - Database schemas or data models
     - Workflows, processes, or user interaction patterns

     This prohibition applies regardless of whether you copy the code directly,
     rewrite it in another programming language, or substantially replicate
     the functionality or design by studying the Software. If a feature or
     component exists in the Software and a substantially similar feature
     appears in a competing product after the creator had access to the
     Software, this shall be considered a violation of this License.

  c) DERIVATIVE COMPETITION PROHIBITION: Create any product, service, or
     offering that:

     - Replicates or substantially imitates features of the Software
     - Is inspired by or derived from studying the Software's implementation
     - Uses knowledge gained from the Software to build competing functionality
     - Combines portions of the Software with other code to create a competitor

     This applies to both the existing features at the time of access AND any
     new features subsequently added to the Software. Competitors who have
     accessed the Software are prohibited from implementing substantially
     similar features for a period of five (5) years after such features are
     publicly released in the Software.

  d) CIRCUMVENTION PROHIBITION: Remove, obscure, or modify any licensing,
     copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices contained in the
     Software. You may not use technical or other means to circumvent any
     limitations or restrictions in this License.

  e) COMMERCIAL REDISTRIBUTION PROHIBITION: Sell, license, sublicense, or
     otherwise commercially distribute the Software or derivative works
     thereof as a standalone product, unless expressly authorized in writing
     by the Licensor.

  f) TRADEMARK PROHIBITION: Use the Licensor's name, trademarks, service marks,
     logos, or brand identifiers without prior written permission, except as
     required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
     Software (e.g., "Based on Creet.io").

  g) REVERSE ENGINEERING FOR COMPETITION: Study, analyze, reverse engineer,
     or examine the Software for the purpose of building competing products
     or services. This includes:

     - Reading source code to understand implementation details for replication
     - Analyzing UI/UX patterns for competitive implementation
     - Studying API behavior or internal workflows for competing products
     - Benchmarking or feature comparison for competitive development

     Note: This restriction does not apply to security research conducted in
     good faith and disclosed responsibly to the Licensor.

     application does not compete with the Software.

  d) MODIFICATIONS FOR PERSONAL/INTERNAL USE: You may freely modify the
     Software for your own use or your organization's internal use without
